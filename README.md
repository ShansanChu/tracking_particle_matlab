# Tracking Particle Matlab
## Image processing with band filter
Band filter is applied to reduce the noise of images. Band filter is applied to reduce noise of images. Low frequency is used to remove high frequency noise such as salt-and-pepper noise. 
This is collections of codes employed to recognize particles. The filter and particle localization part is from another group.
